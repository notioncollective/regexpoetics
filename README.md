regexpoetics
============

A simple interface for turning regular expression patterns into osc messages.

## Instructions

Install npm dependencies:

	npm install

Install bower dependencies:

	bower install

Start the server:

	grunt

Open up your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## OSC Endpoints

 * `/com/notioncollective/key` - fires on every keydown in text input
 * `/com/notioncollective/notes` - each individual matched note is a separate param, with a number
 * `/com/notioncollective/notes/[n]` same as above, but only for the selected regex
 * `/com/notioncollective/words` - word count for entire contents of text input
 * `/com/notioncollective/chars` - chartacter count for entire contents of text input
 * `/com/notioncollective/count` - count of matches for all regexes
 * `/com/notioncollective/count/[n]` - count of matches for regex #n

## Some handy regular expressions

 * `/[^\s]*?abc[^\s]*?$/` - Capture words that contain "abc" only if they are the last word in the line
 * _How to do **not** "money"? [Almost there but not quite](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/406230/regular-expression-to-match-string-not-containing-a-word)_

## Todo

 - Menu bar for various options
 	- OSC send parameters (ip, port)
 	- Reset button
 		- reset text
 		- send "stop" osc message
 - Add additional messages based on stats, etc
 	- Global
 		- Word count
 		- Char count
 		- Bang per key press
 	- Per regex
 		- Count
 		- Musical notes
 			- Would parse all matches and then trigger notes for each match
 - Maybe we should use captures and not matches? Have to theink about this a bit
 - Abstract messaging a bit so that all osc messages are also sent back to the client
 - Update namespacing to "/com/nc/regexpoetics/" ? Or something project-specific.
 - BUG: Sometimes live updating interferes with your typing.
 	- Possible fix: each client gets a client id, sends that id with messages.
